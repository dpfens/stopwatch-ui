          <div class="text-block primary">
            <p class="opening-statement">A few years back, I went to a track meet to watch my old college team compete. I tried timing some runners with my phone's stopwatch, wanting to see how the team had progressed since I was on it.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="text-block secondary rotated-left">
            <p>I was trying to time 3 multiple people and ended up spending the entire time focused on how to make my mess of a timer work instead of actually watching the race and taking split on the side. I lost track of whose splits were whose and what each split was supposed to indicate/record (ex. I took a split when they passed/were passed key people, or when they fell, as well as their laps and 200m splits). At the end, I was never really sure of whose splits were whose and felt like I wasted my time and effort. I did it for a couple other races with similarly poor results. I looked at other people at the meet, and they seemed to simply introduce more people, and have each person time a single person/relay.</p>

            <div class="quote-block">
              <div class="quote-bar"></div>
              <p>The experience stuck with me. Handling multiple timers gracefully seemed like something some timing company or even a couple junior developer would have solved already.  More importantly, I'd only tried timing a couple races out of an entire meet. </p>

            <p>Coaches and athletes deal with this constantly while trying to focus on what actually matters which is supporting their team, cheering at the right moments, giving real-time feedback. It seemed ridiculous that such a basic need was forcing people to choose between getting useful data and being present for their athletes. It was also frustrating that companies are out there building extravagant tools requiring very complex code, and yet solutions to my problem are still common. So while I was watching TV I'd idly sketch out some ideas of what one might look like.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="text-block primary asymmetric">
            <p>But, then COVID-19 lockdown about 10 months later and I had a lot of time on my hands. So I decided to try building my own. I built it in ~3 weeks, working on it while I watched TV after work. It had no polish whatsoever, but it worked. I posted it to Reddit, and got some really helpful objective and functional feedback. Within a couple weeks I had about a couple hundred weekly users. I thought they would all eventually forget about it, but the numbers slowly creeped up, despite me not posting more about it.</p>

              <p>I would use it periodically myself when I needed it. But I thought it was interesting that apparently other folks do too. This kept me thinking about it every few weeks. I would think of how I could have done a better job.</p>
              <p>Over the course of a few months I came up with features it could use until I had a nice laundry list of new feature to add that seemed worthwhile. Then I figured out how I would need to build it so I could continue adding stuff to it in the future. This is important because I wanted it to be local-first. Since with local-first apps you can't restructure the data on your own between upgrades, I knew I had to get the fundamentals of it exactly right ahead of time. Once I had that, I knew I was ready to build version 2.</p>
              <p class="final-statement">This is that Version 2. Same fundamental idea as the first, but rebuilt to be more reliable, easier to use, and easier for me to work on.</p>

              <h3>The Problem with V1</h3>
              <p>In version 1, I was using an early version of VueJS which did not have services for inter-communication across an application. This made cross-communication between different parts/page of the application very difficult.</p>
              <p>In v1, my stopwatches only stored aggregate runtime data to make run faster, not the full time series of start/stops/splits. This had numerous bad effects:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Adding a new type of split meant I had to completely rebuild the stopwatch to add a new type of split.</li>
                <li>Removing splits/laps was very complicated because I had to manually edit several quantitative state variables to keep the stopwatch data correct.</li>
                <li>There was no way to merge stopwatches and/or split a stopwatch into multiple because too much data would be lost.</li>

              <p>For work, sometimes I had to build analytics platforms. Mainly for time series analysis for folks who don't have the time at work to actually analyze data themselves. Neither do the people running stopwatches. During a race, they want to focus on the race, not on number-crunching. So I figured I could get the app to do some number crunching for them. For now, I'm starting simple and I can add more over time.</p>

              <div class="solution-highlight">
                <p>The second version stores every aspect of the stopwatch execution as separate event with a timestamp. Starting, stopping, and resuming the stopwatch are all separate timestamps, as well as taking splits. This greatly simplifies the logic for removing splits and for adding new split types, as the fundamental data structure doesn't change. Now adding another split only involves adding split-specific processing logic for that on behalf of the user.</p>
